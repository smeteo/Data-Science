# Machine Learning Project 1: Car Price Prediction
Welcome to "Car Price Prediction Project". This is a medium project of Machine Learning course. In this project you will have the opportunity to apply many algorithms commonly used for regression problems.

Also, you will apply various processes such as pre-processing, train-test spilit and cross validation that you will use in algorithm modeling and prediction processes in Python with scikit-learn. 

Steps include;
    -Import Modules, Load Data and Data Review  
    -Data Pre-Processing  
    -Implement Linear Regression  
    -Implement Ridge Regression  
    -Implement Lasso Regression
