# Credit Card Transaction Fraud Dection Capstone Project - Supervised Classification

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where it has 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

|Feature | Description|
|---|---|
|Time |This feature contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.|
|Amount| This feature is the transaction Amount, can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning.|
|Class |This feature is the target variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.|
|V1 - V28 |Anonymous features.|
