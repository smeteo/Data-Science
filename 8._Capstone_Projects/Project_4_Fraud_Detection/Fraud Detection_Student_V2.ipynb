So the algorithms are much more likely to classify new observations to the majority class and high accuracy won't tell us anything. To address the problem of imbalanced dataset we can use undersampling and oversampling data approach techniques. Oversampling increases the number of minority class members in the training set. The advantage of oversampling is that no information from the original training set is lost unlike in undersampling, as all observations from the minority and majority classes are kept. On the other hand, it is prone to overfitting. \n","\n","There is a type of oversampling called **[SMOTE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-handling-imbalanced-data-with-smote-and-near-miss-algorithm-in-python/)** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), which we are going to use to make our dataset balanced.
