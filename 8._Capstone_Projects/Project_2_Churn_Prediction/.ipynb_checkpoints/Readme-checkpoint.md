# Employee Churn Analysis Project

In this project you have HR data of a company. A study is requested from you to predict which employee will churn by using this data.

The HR dataset has 14,999 samples. In the given dataset, you have two types of employee one who stayed and another who left the company.

#### 4. Cluster Analysis  
Find the optimal number of clusters (k) using the elbow method for for K-means.  
Determine the clusters by using K-Means then Evaluate predicted results.  
#### 5. Model Building  
Split Data as Train and Test set  
Built Gradient Boosting Classifier, Evaluate Model Performance and Predict Test Data  
Built K Neighbors Classifier and Evaluate Model Performance and Predict Test Data  
Built Random Forest Classifier and Evaluate Model Performance and Predict Test Data  
#### 6. Model Deployement  
Save and Export the Model as .pkl  
Save and Export Variables as .pkl  

#### 7. Running Model on AWS EC2
