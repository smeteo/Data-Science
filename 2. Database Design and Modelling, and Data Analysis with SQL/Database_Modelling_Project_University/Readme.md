# A University Registration Data Model and Database

Design the university database which is one possible data model that describes the below set of requirements.

## The University Database Requirements:

Here is a statement of the data requirements for a product to support the registration and provide help to students of a fictitious e-learning university.

An e-learning university needs to keep details of its students and staff, the courses that it offers and the performance of the students who study its courses. The university is
administered in four geographical regions (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland).

Information about each student should be initially recorded at registration. This includes the studentâ€™s identification number issued at the time, name, year of registration and the
region in which the student is located. A student is not required to enroll in any courses at registration; enrollment in a course can happen at a later time.
